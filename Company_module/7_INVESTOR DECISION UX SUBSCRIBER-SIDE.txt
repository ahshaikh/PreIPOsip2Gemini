STEP 3 — INVESTOR DECISION UX (SUBSCRIBER-SIDE)
Now we move to the subscriber-facing side, where everything must be:
- clear
- non-promotional
- comparable
- compliant

A. INVESTOR LANDING — COMPANY PAGE (TOP FOLD)
Header Section
- Company name + logo
- Sector, stage, founded year
- Status badge:
  - Live – Limited
  - Live – Investable
  - Live – Fully Disclosed
- Risk grade (platform-generated)
- Liquidity label: Low / Medium / High

Prominent disclaimer (always visible):
“This is an unlisted, illiquid investment. There is no guaranteed exit.”

B. DISCLOSURE COMPLETENESS BAR (TRUST SIGNAL)
Visual progress bar:

Disclosure completeness: 72%
✔ Business
✔ Management
✔ Risks
⏳ Financials
❗ Valuation

Hover tooltips explain:
- what’s missing
- why it matters

C. SECTION-BY-SECTION CONTENT MODEL
Cover each and every section mentioned (Total 13) in the file named Company_details_for_users.txt
Each section has three layers clearly separated.
1. What the Company Says
Pulled directly from approved disclosures
Read-only, neutral formatting.

2. Platform Context (Critical)
Clearly labeled:
- “Platform context”
Examples:
- “Revenue growth is strong, but profitability is yet to be achieved.”
- “Valuation is higher than listed peers; upside depends on IPO pricing.”
No advice. No recommendation.

3. Status Indicator
✔ Verified
⏳ Under Review
⏸ Not Disclosed

This avoids false confidence.

D. FINANCIALS SECTION (INVESTOR-READY)
- 3–5 year table
- Simple charts (revenue, profit/loss)
- Cash burn indicator
- Auditor name

If under review:
  “Financials are under admin verification. Final numbers may change.”

E. OFFER DETAILS & BUY GATING
If NOT investable:
- Buy button disabled
- Message:
  “Investing will open once financial and offer details are approved.”

If investable:
- Buy button enabled
- Summary:
  - price
  - minimum ticket
  - lock-in
  - share type
  - holding structure

No “returns” language allowed.

F. RISK ACKNOWLEDGMENT FLOW (MANDATORY)
Before buying, investor must acknowledge:
1. Illiquidity
2. Valuation uncertainty
3. No guaranteed exit
4. Platform role (not advisor)

Checkboxes + timestamp + IP logged.
Cannot proceed without all checked.

G. VERSION & UPDATE VISIBILITY
Every section shows:
- “Last updated on”
- “Reviewed by admin on”

If updated after investor viewed:
  “This section was updated since your last visit.”

This is a huge trust enhancer.

H. COMPARISON & SAVED ANALYSIS
Investors can:
- Bookmark companies
- Compare 2–3 companies on:
  - sector
  - valuation
  - risk grade
  - disclosure completeness

No ranking, no nudging.
