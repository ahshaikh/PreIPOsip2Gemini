Step 1
ADMIN REVIEW & VETTING WORKFLOW
(Designed for Partial Go-Live + Continuous Disclosure)

1. Core Principles (Non-Negotiable)
 1. Approval is modular, not binary
 2. Public visibility is tiered
 3. Admins never edit company data
 4. Clarifications are first-class citizens
 5. Anything shown to investors is explicitly approved
 6. Unapproved sections are clearly marked

2. Disclosure Modules & Approval Levels
We divide disclosures into three tiers.

TIER 1 — BASIC (Required for Go-Live)
Without this → company is NOT visible → with this completed, company appear in Upcoming Deals section of the frontend

Module			Purpose
Company Identity	Who they are
Business Overview	What they do
Management Snapshot	Who runs it
Basic Risk Declaration	High-level risks

Once all Tier 1 modules are approved, the company becomes:
“Live – Limited Disclosure”  → Company visible in Upcoming Deals sections

TIER 2 — FINANCIAL & OFFER (Investment-Critical)
Required before any buying is enabled

Module			Purpose
Financials		Numbers
Capital Structure	What investor gets
Offer Details		Price, lock-in
Valuation Rationale	Pricing logic

Until Tier 2 is approved:
Company page is viewable only  → after approval  → Buy button is enabled

TIER 3 — ADVANCED (Depth & Confidence)
Improves investor trust, not mandatory for buying

Module			Purpose
Governance Deep Dive	Board, controls
Exit Scenarios		Liquidity thinking
Extended Risk Notes	Edge cases
Ongoing Updates		Discipline signal

3. Company Status State Machine
This is critical for backend logic.

DRAFT
 ↓
SUBMITTED (Tier 1)
 ↓
LIVE_LIMITED
 ↓
UNDER_REVIEW (Tier 2)
 ↓
LIVE_INVESTABLE
 ↓
LIVE_FULLY_DISCLOSED

Status meanings
Status			Investor Visibility
DRAFT			None
SUBMITTED		None
LIVE_LIMITED		View only
LIVE_INVESTABLE		View + Buy
LIVE_FULLY_DISCLOSED	View + Buy + High Trust

4. Admin Review Queues (Operational Design)

Admins do not review companies. They review disclosure modules.

Admin Dashboard Queues
1. New Submissions
 - Tier 1 pending
2. Clarification Required
 - Company responded
3. Re-submissions
 - Updated versions
4. Periodic Review
 - Quarterly updates
5. Flags & Incidents
 - Complaints / anomalies

5. Clarification Workflow (Core Loop)
This is the heart of our system.

Flow

Company submits →
Admin reviews →
Admin asks questions →
Company responds →
Admin reviews again →
Approve / Ask again

Unlimited loops supported.

Backend entities involved
- company_disclosure_versions
- disclosure_queries
- disclosure_responses
- admin_reviews

Key rule
A disclosure can only move to approved if all queries are closed.

6. Partial Approval Logic (Important)
A company can be:

Tier 1: approved
Tier 2: pending clarification
Tier 3: not started

How this reflects publicly
Section			Status Badge
Business Overview	✔ Verified
Financials		⏳ Under Review
Valuation		❗ Pending
Exit			⏸ Not Disclosed

This avoids misrepresentation without blocking discovery.

7. Buy Enablement Rules (Hard Gates)
Buying is enabled ONLY if:
1. Company status = LIVE_INVESTABLE
2. Tier 2 modules all approved
3. No active freeze
4. Investor has acknowledged risks

8. Freeze, Rollback & Enforcement

Admins can freeze at any time.
Freeze triggers
1. Misrepresentation
2. Missed updates
3. Regulatory concern
4. Legal notice

Freeze effects
- Buying disabled immediately
- Banner shown to investors
- Status → SUSPENDED
- Existing investments unaffected

9. Change Management After Go-Live
Material change examples
- New funding round
- Change in valuation
- New litigation
- Promoter exit

Required behavior
- Company must submit updated disclosure
- Previous version remains visible (archived)
- Admin re-approves
- Investors see “Updated on X”

This is critical for trust.

10. Audit & Defensibility (Why This Survives Scrutiny)
We can always answer:
- Who said what?
- When?
- Based on which document?
- Who approved it?
- What changed later?

Because:
- Companies submit
- Admins approve
- Platform interprets
- Investors acknowledge

All separately logged.
