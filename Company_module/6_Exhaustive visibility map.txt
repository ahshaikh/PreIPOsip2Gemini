Below is a clear, exhaustive visibility map, split by role and frontend surface, answering exactly:

“What all can we see?” —not what exists in theory, but what is actually rendered, interacted with, or hidden.

1. COMPANY (ISSUER) FRONTEND
(Founder / Finance / Legal users)
This is not one screen. It is a workflow-driven console.

A. Company Home / Dashboard
Visible elements
- Company name, logo
- Current lifecycle status:
  - Draft
  - Live – Limited
  - Live – Investable
  - Live – Fully Disclosed
  - Suspended
- “Last reviewed by admin on”
- “Next action required”

Progress visualization
- Tier-wise disclosure progress:
  - Tier 1 (Basic)
  - Tier 2 (Financial & Offer)
  - Tier 3 (Advanced)

What they can NOT see
- Platform context
- Platform scores
- Investor-facing interpretations

B. Disclosure Modules (Per Module View)
For each module (Business, Financials, Valuation, Risks, etc.):

Visible
- Module status:
  - Draft
  - Submitted
  - Under Review
  - Clarification Required
  - Approved
- Version history (v1, v2, v3…)
- Admin questions (threaded)
- Their own past responses
- Uploaded documents

Editable when
- Draft
- Under Review
- Clarification Required

Locked when
- Approved

Special controls
- “Report Error / Omission”
- “Submit revised version”

C. Clarification Conversation Screen

Visible
- Admin questions (verbatim)
- Status of each question

- Platform risk flags

D. Company Settings / Team

Visible
- Company users
- Roles (founder, finance, legal, viewer)
- Authorized signatory
- Max user quota

E. What Company NEVER Sees
- Platform risk scores
- Platform valuation context
- Investor acknowledgements
- Other companies
- Admin-only flags
- How investors are reacting

This separation is intentional and critical.

2. ADMIN FRONTEND
(Governance, review, enforcement)
Admins see everything, but not as companies or investors do.

A. Admin Dashboard (Global)

Visible
- Companies by lifecycle state
- Pending disclosures by tier
- Clarifications awaiting response
- Recently edited under-review modules
- Frozen / suspended companies

B. Company Review View (Admin-Side)
For a single company:

Visible
- Full company master record
- All disclosure modules
- All versions
- All clarification threads
- Edit diffs between versions
- Disclosure completeness score (internal)
- Platform-generated context (draft + published)

C. Disclosure Review Screen
Per module:

Visible
- Submitted payload (structured)
- Documents
- Previous versions
- Clarification history
- Company self-reported errors

Actions
- Approve
- Reject
- Ask clarification
- Freeze company (if needed)

Mandatory
- Admin remarks
- Identity attribution (who approved)

D. Platform Context Controls (Admin Only)

Admins can:
- Review auto-generated platform context
- Approve publishing of context
- Override with justification (logged)

Admins cannot
- Edit company disclosures
- Hide audit trails
- Remove past versions

E. Enforcement & Incident View

Visible
- Freeze reason
- Affected investors
- Timeline of events
- Audit log entries

3. INVESTOR / SUBSCRIBER FRONTEND
(Read-only + transactional)
This is the most constrained surface.

A. Company Listing / Discovery

Visible
- Company name, logo
- Sector, stage
- Status badge:
  - Live – Limited
  - Live – Investable
  - Live – Fully Disclosed
- Disclosure completeness %
- Platform risk band
- Liquidity label

Not visible
- Draft companies
- Suspended companies (unless previously invested)

B. Company Detail Page (Core)
Each section shows three layers clearly:

1. Company Disclosure (Verified)
- What the company said
- Only approved content
- Read-only

2. Platform Context (Clearly Labeled)
- Risk highlights
- Comparatives
- Interpretation
- Disclosure gaps

3. Status Indicators

✔ Verified
⏳ Under Review
⏸ Not Disclosed

C. Financials Section

Visible
- Historical numbers
- Trends
- Auditor name
- Cash runway indicators

Not visible
- Forward projections
- Internal admin notes

D. Buy / Invest Flow
Visible (only if allowed)
- Offer price
- Security type
- Lock-in
- Minimum ticket

Mandatory gates
- Risk acknowledgement
- Illiquidity acknowledgement
- Platform non-advisory acknowledgement

If not investable
- Buy button disabled
- Clear explanation why

E. Post-Investment View

Visible
- Snapshot of what they saw at investment time
- Investment status
- Disclosures at time of investment
- Subsequent updates (marked as “after investment”)

F. What Investor NEVER Sees
- Draft or under-review raw data
- Clarification conversations
- Admin remarks
- Other investors
- Company internal responses
- Platform internal scoring logic

4. PLATFORM CONTEXT (WHERE IT APPEARS)
This deserves its own clarity.

Where Platform Context IS Visible
- Investor company pages
- Comparison views
- Risk banners
- Disclosure completeness indicators

Always labeled as:
- “Platform context”
- “Platform interpretation”

Where Platform Context IS NOT Visible
- Company dashboards
- Company disclosures
- Company exports
- Raw data APIs

This preserves neutrality.

5. CROSS-CUTTING VISIBILITY (ALL ROLES)
Audit Trails
- Admins: full visibility
- Companies: only their own submissions
- Investors: none (except snapshots)

Notifications
- Companies: clarifications, approvals, freezes
- Admins: submissions, edits, incidents
- Investors: material updates (only for invested companies)

FINAL SUMMARY TABLE (MENTAL MODEL)
Role		Can Submit	Can Edit	Can Interpret	Can Approve	Can Buy
Company		✅		Until approval	❌		❌		❌
Admin		❌		❌		✅		✅		❌
Investor	❌		❌		❌		❌		✅ (gated)

Why this matters
If we ever feel confused later, remember this invariant:
No single role can both write data and judge it and profit from it.

This invariant is upheld across all phases we designed.
