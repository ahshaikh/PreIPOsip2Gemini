LIST 0

We are not building just an investor-facing page — it is a two-sided disclosure system:

Company → Platform (mandatory, structured, auditable disclosures)
Platform → Investor (interpreted, risk-balanced, compliant presentation)

Below is a complete, end-to-end blueprint, structured in four layers, exactly as we require — but explicitly two-way by design.

LAYER 0 — CORE PRINCIPLE (This governs everything)
Nothing appears on the investor page unless it is first collected, validated and logged from the company.

This protects us legally, operationally and reputationally.
Every data point must have:
- Source (company declaration / document / third-party)
- Timestamp
- Responsibility owner (company vs platform)

LAYER 1 — TWO-WAY INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE (FOUNDATION)
A. Company Disclosure Intake (Private, Mandatory)

This is not a form. It is a structured disclosure workflow.
Each company must submit data across 8 compulsory modules:

Module			Mandatory	Evidence Required
Company Identity	Yes		Incorporation docs
Business Model		Yes		Written declaration
Financials		Yes		CA-certified statements
Cap Table & Securities	Yes		Share register
Valuation & Pricing	Yes		Term sheet / rationale
Governance & Management	Yes		Board details
Risks & Disclosures	Yes		Signed risk declaration
Exit & Liquidity	Yes		Written policy

No submission → no listing.

B. Investor Information Output (Public, Interpreted)
What investors see is:
- Structured
- Comparable
- Risk-balanced
- Annotated (company-sourced vs platform analysis)

LAYER 2 — UI WIREFRAME (BOTH SIDES)
A. Company-Side UI (Disclosure Dashboard)
1. Disclosure Progress Tracker
[✓] Company Profile
[✓] Financials
[✓] Cap Table
[⚠] Valuation Rationale (Needs clarification)
[✓] Risks & Disclosures
[ ] Exit Plan (Pending)

- Companies cannot publish until 100% complete
- Changes require re-acknowledgement

2. Structured Disclosure Forms (Example: Valuation)
Company must answer:
- Last funding round valuation
- Date of valuation
- Valuation method (DCF / comparables / negotiated)
- Assumptions used
- Reason for current offer price
- Comparison with listed peers (company-provided)

Hard rule:
Free text + structured fields + document upload.

3. Legal Acknowledgement (Critical)
Before submission:
“I confirm that the information provided is complete, accurate, and not misleading. I understand this will be shown to investors.”
This matters in disputes.

B. Investor-Side UI (Decision Page Wireframe)
Section 1 — Snapshot (Top Fold)
- Company name, sector, stage
- Offer price, minimum investment
- Risk grade (derived, not company-supplied)
- Liquidity status (Low / Medium / High)

Section 2 — What the Company Does
Source: Company disclosure
Platform adds: Plain-language summary

Show both:
“Company says”
“Platform interpretation”

Section 3 — Financial Reality
- 3–5 year financial table
- Profit / loss trend
- Cash burn
- Auditor details

Platform annotation:
“Company is loss-making but revenue CAGR is X%.”

Section 4 — Offer Details (Non-Negotiable Clarity)
- Security type
- Lock-in
- Dilution impact
- Shareholding mechanism

No marketing language allowed here.

Section 5 — Valuation Analysis
Split into two panels:

Company’s Rationale
Platform’s Comparative Context

This is where credibility is built.

Section 6 — Risks (Mandatory Scroll)
- Business risk
- Liquidity risk
- Regulatory risk
- Platform structure risk

Users must acknowledge before investing.

Section 7 — Exit Scenarios
- Best / base / worst case
- No guarantees clearly stated

Section 8 — Documents Vault
- Financials
- Cap table summary
- Offer note
- Risk disclosure

LAYER 3 — COMPLIANCE-ALIGNED PRODUCT SPEC
Core Compliance Principles Applied
Even without explicit regulations on Pre-IPOs, let's align with:
- Fair disclosure
- No misrepresentation
- Risk prominence
- Suitability signalling

Product Rules (Hard Constraints)
1. No return projections
2. No guaranteed exit language
3. Risk section cannot be collapsed
4. Company claims must be attributable
5. Material updates require re-disclosure

Audit Trail (Very Important)
Every field:
- Who submitted
- When
- What changed
- Previous version retained

This protects us in audits, disputes and regulator queries.

LAYER 4 — STANDARDIZED COMPANY SCORING MODEL`1
This score is platform-generated, never company-provided.

Score Components (Example: 100-point scale)
Category			Weight
Financial Health		25
Governance Quality		20
Business Model Clarity		15
Valuation Reasonableness	15
Risk Profile			15
Liquidity Outlook		10

Output to Investors
- Overall Risk Grade: A / B / C / D
- Sub-scores shown transparently
- Explanation for each score

This allows comparison without advice.

LAYER 5 — REGULATORY BEST-PRACTICE MAPPING (ABSTRACTED)
Our page should implicitly aligns with expectations from regulators like SEBI by:
- Emphasizing risk over upside
- Avoiding solicitation language
- Enforcing issuer disclosures
- Avoiding selective disclosure
- Maintaining auditability

We are acting as a disclosure facilitator, not as an investment advisor.

FINAL STRATEGIC INSIGHT (IMPORTANT)
What we are actually building is:
A trust infrastructure for illiquid private markets.

Platforms fail here when they:
- Let companies oversell
- Hide risks
- Skip structured disclosure

Platforms win when they:
- Force discipline on issuers
- Educate investors
- Document everything

LIST A. User see all of the following sections:

To help a retail customer make an informed decision to buy a Pre-IPO offering, our detail page must answer four core questions clearly and defensibly:
1. What am I buying?
2. Why might this become more valuable?
3. What are the risks and constraints?
4. How and when can I exit?

Below is a comprehensive, decision-grade structure we should use to design the page. This is written from the perspective of investor psychology + regulatory reality, not marketing.

1. Company Snapshot (Immediate Orientation)
Purpose: Help the user understand what kind of business this is in 30 seconds.
Include:
- Company name, logo, incorporation year
- Legal entity type (Private Ltd / LLP / Overseas entity)
- Registered location
- Industry & sub-sector
- Core product / service (1–2 sentences)
- Business stage (Early growth / Late-stage / Pre-listing)
This prevents impulse investing based on brand name alone.

2. Business Model & Revenue Clarity
Purpose: Answer “How does this company actually make money?”
Include:
- Revenue streams (primary + secondary)
- Pricing model (subscription, commission, licensing, etc.)
- Customer segments (B2B / B2C / Govt / Enterprise)
- Key geographies
- Unit economics (if available)

Avoid jargon.
If revenue is not stable, explicitly state that.

3. Financial Performance (Last 3–5 Years)
Purpose: Ground the decision in numbers, not narratives.
Include:
- Revenue growth (YoY)
- EBITDA / Profit / Loss
- Cash burn (if loss-making)
- Debt vs equity
- Auditor name
- Last valuation and basis

Add plain-language interpretation:
“The company is still loss-making but revenue has grown at X% CAGR.”

4. Market Opportunity & Industry Context
Purpose: Justify why this company could grow further.
Include:
- Target market size (TAM / SAM / SOM if credible)
- Industry growth rate
- Competitive landscape
- Key tailwinds (policy, tech, demand)
- Structural risks (regulation, capital intensity)

Avoid hype. Cite sources where possible.

5. Competitive Positioning
Purpose: Answer “Why this company, not another?”
Include:
- Top 5 competitors (listed + private)
- Differentiators (cost, moat, IP, distribution)
- Market share (if available)
- Switching costs / customer stickiness

If the company is not differentiated, say so.

6. Management & Governance
Purpose: Investors buy people, not just balance sheets.
Include:
- Founders’ background (education, prior exits)
- Promoter shareholding
- Board composition (independent vs promoter)
- Any related-party transactions
- Key governance red flags (if any)

This is where trust is built or broken.

7. Pre-IPO Offering Details (Critical Section)
Purpose: Clarify exactly what the user is buying.
Include:
- Type of shares (equity / CCPS / CCD)
- Price per share
- Minimum investment
- Lock-in period
- Shareholding post-investment (dilution impact)
- How shares are held (demat / SPV / trust)

This must be unambiguous.

8. Valuation Rationale
Purpose: Prevent blind price anchoring.
Include:
- Current valuation vs last funding round
- Valuation multiples (P/E, EV/Revenue, etc.)
- Comparable listed companies
- Premium / discount justification

Add a neutral statement:
“At this price, future returns depend heavily on IPO valuation and timing.”

9. Exit Scenarios & Liquidity
Purpose: Set realistic expectations.
Include:
- Expected IPO timeline (best / base / worst case)
- Secondary sale possibility
- Buyback clauses (if any)
- Liquidity risks

Be explicit:
“There is no guaranteed exit.”

10. Risk Disclosure (Non-Negotiable)
Purpose: Protect users and the platform.
Include:
- Business risks
- Regulatory risks (including SEBI positioning on unlisted securities)
- Liquidity risk
- Valuation risk
- Execution risk
- Platform-specific risk (SPV, custody, counterparty)

This should be clear, not buried.

11. Suitability Guidance (Investor Fit)
Purpose: Prevent mis-selling.
Include:
- Ideal investor profile (HNI / Long-term / High risk tolerance)
- Time horizon required
- Portfolio allocation guidance (e.g., “Not more than X% of net worth”)

This builds credibility and reduces disputes.

12. Document Vault & Transparency
Purpose: Enable due diligence.
Include:
- Financial statements
- Shareholder agreement (redacted)
- Cap table (summary)
- Legal opinions (if available)
- Risk note / offer note

Even partial disclosure is better than none.

13. Decision Summary (Investor-Friendly)
End with a balanced summary:
Why investors may consider this
X, Y, Z

Why investors should be cautious
A, B, C

This signals platform integrity.

Strategic Insight for PreIPOsip (Important)
A platform that:
- highlights risks clearly
- explains downside as well as upside
- discourages unsuitable investors

will:
- attract more serious capital
- reduce regulatory exposure
- build long-term trust

This is especially important in India’s evolving unlisted securities space.
