STEP 4 — LEGAL, COMPLIANCE & AUDIT LAYER
(The “Why We Will Survive Scrutiny” Layer)

A. CORE POSITIONING (VERY IMPORTANT)
We must be internally and externally consistent on what we are:

    We are a disclosure and transaction facilitation platform, not an investment advisor, not a distributor,
    and not a portfolio manager.

The whole logic of writing this document is, everything below should enforces this positioning technically and legally.

B. ISSUER-SIDE LEGAL & COMPLIANCE CONTROLS
1. Issuer Master Declaration (Non-Negotiable)

Before any company can go live (even Tier 1):
One-time declaration, digitally signed:

“I confirm that all information provided is true, complete, and not misleading.
I acknowledge that this information will be relied upon by investors.
I understand that misrepresentation may result in suspension, disclosure to investors, and legal action.”

Stored in DB:
- signed_at
- IP address
- authorised signatory ID

This shifts primary liability to the issuer.

2. Module-Level Declarations (Granular Liability)
Every module submission includes:
- “To the best of my knowledge…”
- “No material facts omitted…”
- “Updated as of [date]”

Why this matters:
- A wrong valuation claim ≠ wrong financials claim
- Liability is scoped, not global

3. Continuous Disclosure Obligation (Critical)
Issuers must explicitly agree to:
- Report material changes
- Within X business days
- Failure may result in:
  - Freeze
  - Public disclosure of non-compliance

This is enforced by:
- contractual clause
- admin tooling
- public “Last updated” indicators

C. INVESTOR-SIDE LEGAL SAFEGUARDS (HARD GATES)
1. Platform Role Disclosure (Always Visible)
Displayed on:
- company pages
- checkout
- acknowledgements

Text (paraphrased, not legalese):
“The platform does not provide investment advice or recommendations.
All investment decisions are made solely by the investor.”

This protects against advisory classification.

2. Mandatory Risk Acknowledgement (Logged)
Before every first investment, investor must acknowledge:
1. Unlisted securities are illiquid
2. Valuation is uncertain
3. Exit is not guaranteed
4. Capital loss is possible
5. Platform is not an advisor

Technically enforced:
- Checkboxes
- Timestamp
- IP
- User ID
- Company ID

Stored forever.

3. Suitability Positioning (Subtle but Critical)
We do not assess suitability.

We instead say:
   “This investment may be suitable only for investors with a high risk tolerance and long-term horizon.”

This is guidance, not advice.

D. PLATFORM-SIDE COMPLIANCE CONTROLS
1. No Return Projections (Hard Rule)
Our system must technically prevent:
- IRR fields
- CAGR promises
- “Expected return” text

Why:
- This is the fastest way to regulatory trouble

2. Language Controls (Marketing Guardrails)
Disallowed phrases (examples):
- “Guaranteed”
- “Safe”
- “Assured”
- “Best investment”

Our CMS / content layer should:
- flag
- block
- require admin override

3. Separation of Data vs Interpretation
Our architecture already does this, but legally:

Layer			Responsibility
Company disclosures	Issuer
Platform context	Platform
Investment decision	Investor

This separation must be visible in UI and logs.

E. AUDIT & FORENSIC READINESS (THIS IS WHERE MOST PLATFORMS FAIL)
1. Immutable Audit Trails
We already designed:
- versioned disclosures
- admin decisions
- clarification logs

Now enforce:
- No hard deletes
- No overwrite
- Before/after state capture

This allows us to reconstruct:
    “What did the investor see at the time of investment?”

This is crucial in time of need.

2. Investor Snapshot at Transaction Time
At the moment of investment:
- Snapshot the public company profile
- Snapshot disclosure status
- Store hash/reference

Why:
- Later updates should not rewrite history

3. Admin Action Accountability
Admins must:
- sign reviews
- leave remarks
- be traceable

This avoids “platform negligence” claims.

F. DISPUTE & INCIDENT HANDLING FRAMEWORK
1. If Company Misrepresents
Platform actions:
- Freeze company
- Disable buying
- Add public notice:
   “Company is under review due to disclosure inconsistencies.”

Legal posture:
- Platform acted on disclosed info
- Platform intervened on discovery

2. If Investor Complains
We can show:
- acknowledgements
- disclosures viewed
- timestamps
- warnings shown

This is best defense.

G. REGULATORY ALIGNMENT (WITHOUT OVER-COMMITTING)
We do not claim regulation unless required.
Instead, we say:
   “The platform follows disclosure, transparency, and risk communication practices aligned with market best practices.”

This avoids false regulatory representation while showing intent.
We are trying to build a governed private-market infrastructure, not just a marketplace.
