STEP 2 — COMPANY SUBMISSION UX (ISSUER-SIDE)

Goal:
Enable companies to submit complete, structured, auditable disclosures, tolerate multiple clarification cycles and progressively unlock visibility, without ever allowing marketing spin or silent edits.

A. UX PRINCIPLES (WHY THIS SHOULD WORK)
1. Progressive disclosure, not a long form
2. Hard separation between “drafting” and “submitted”
3. Clarifications feel normal, not punitive
4. Companies always see what is blocking them
5. Nothing feels optional, only staged

B. ISSUER ENTRY POINT — “COMPANY DASHBOARD”
Primary Header
- Company name + status badge
 - Draft
 - Live – Limited
 - Live – Investable
 - Live – Fully Disclosed
- “Last reviewed on: [date]”
- “Next action required: [module]”

Disclosure Progress Panel (Always Visible)
BASIC (Required to go live)
✔ Company Identity
✔ Business Overview
✔ Management Snapshot
⚠ Risk Declaration (clarification requested)

FINANCIAL & OFFER (Required to enable buying)
⏳ Financials (under review)
❗ Valuation (not submitted)
⏸ Capital Structure (not started)

ADVANCED (Optional, trust-building)
⏸ Governance Deep Dive
⏸ Exit Scenarios

Key UX rule
Every icon is clickable and leads to exactly what is blocking progress.

C. MODULE-BASED SUBMISSION SCREENS
Each module follows the same UX skeleton so users don’t relearn patterns.

1. MODULE SCREEN STRUCTURE (STANDARD)
Top Bar
- Module name
- Status badge:
 - Draft
 - Submitted
 - Under Review
 - Clarification Required
 - Approved
- Version indicator: v3 (latest)

Section 1 — Structured Questions (Mandatory)
Example: Business Overview
- “Describe your core product/service” (textarea, max chars)
- “Primary revenue streams” (multi-select + % split)
- “Top customer segments” (structured)
- “Geographic revenue split” (table)

No free-form uploads alone allowed.
Every document must map to a field.

Section 2 — Supporting Documents
- Upload controls with required labels:
 - “Audited financials FY22–FY25”
 - “Share register”
 - “Board resolution”
- File type & size validation
- Preview + replace (versioned)

Section 3 — Company Declaration (Mandatory)
Checkbox + text:
“I confirm that the above information is complete, accurate and not misleading to the best of my knowledge.”

No submit without this.

Section 4 — Submit / Save Draft
Buttons:
- Save Draft (editable anytime)
- Submit for Review (locks the version)

Once submitted:
- Fields become read-only
- Only a new version can be created

D. CLARIFICATION EXPERIENCE (CORE DIFFERENTIATOR)
This is very critical for our success.
1. Clarification Notification
Company user sees:
- Email
- In-app banner
- Dashboard alert

Example:
“2 clarifications requested on Financials module.”

2. Clarification View (Conversation-Like)
For each clarification:

Admin Question:
“Please explain the spike in revenue in FY24 Q3.”
[Response Text Area]
[Upload Supporting Documents]
[Submit Response]

- Responses are linked to the exact question
- No editing past responses
- Multiple rounds supported

3. Version Handling (Important UX Detail)
Clarifications can result in:
- Simple answer (no new version)
- OR “Submit revised disclosure”

UX explicitly asks:
“Does this response change previously submitted data?”

If YES → new version created
If NO → response only

This preserves audit integrity.

E. PARTIAL GO-LIVE EXPERIENCE (VERY IMPORTANT)
Once Tier 1 is approved:
Company Dashboard Changes
- Status becomes: Live – Limited → visible in Upcoming Deals Section
- Banner:
“Your company is visible to investors with limited disclosure. Buying is disabled until Financial & Offer modules are approved.”

Locked vs Open Modules
- Approved modules → locked (view-only)
- Pending modules → editable
- Advanced modules → optional but highlighted

This prevents accidental regressions.

F. BUY-ENABLEMENT VISIBILITY
When Tier 2 is approved:
- Status updates automatically → Live – Investable
- Dashboard highlights:
	“Your offering is now open for investment.”
Still:
- Any future material change re-triggers review → Company is intimated → Company is suspended for future sale

G. COMPANY USER ROLES & PERMISSIONS (UX-ENFORCED)
Role		Permissions
Founder		Submit all modules
Finance		Financials only
Legal		Risk, governance
Viewer		Read-only

Controlled via:
company_users.role
UX hides actions user cannot perform.

H. COMMON UX SAFEGUARDS (ANTI-MISUSE)
1. No inline editing of approved data
2. No deletion of submitted versions
3. No submission without structured fields
4. No skipping mandatory modules
5. No marketing language prompts

This protects investors and us.

I. ERROR, OMISSION & CORRECTION HANDLING
(Issuer-Side, Module-Level Enhancements)

Real companies will make mistakes, and our system must:
- allow correction
- preserve auditability
- avoid silent edits

A. NEW MODULE STATES (IMPORTANT CHANGE)
Each disclosure module now has finer-grained states:

DRAFT
SUBMITTED
UNDER_REVIEW (EDITABLE)
CLARIFICATION_REQUIRED (EDITABLE)
APPROVED (LOCKED)
REJECTED

Key rule
Modules are editable until APPROVED.

This applies to:
- typos
- missing documents
- incorrect numbers
- misunderstood questions

B. EDIT-WHILE-UNDER-REVIEW UX (CRITICAL)
When module status = UNDER_REVIEW
Issuer sees:
- Fields editable
- Banner at top:
  “This module is under admin review. Any edits will notify the reviewer and reset the review clock.”

Buttons:
- Save Changes
- Save & Notify Reviewer
No hard resubmission needed for small fixes.

C. ERROR / OMISSION DECLARATION (NEW, EXPLICIT)
Each module includes a “Report Error / Omission” action.

UI Placement
- Right sidebar
- Always visible until approval

Clicking it opens:
Prompt:
   “Please describe the error or omission you want to correct.”

Options:
☐ Numerical error
☐ Missing information
☐ Document incorrect
☐ Misinterpretation of question
☐ Other

Text area + optional document upload.

Result
- Logged as a self-reported correction
- Linked to:
  - module
  - version
  - timestamp
- Admin is notified immediately

This is a huge trust signal later.

D. ADMIN VIEW OF EDITS (HOW REVIEWERS SEE IT)
Admins see:
- Highlighted diffs between last reviewed version and current state
- Badge:
  - “Edited after review started”
  - “Self-reported correction”

Admins can:
- Accept changes
- Ask clarification
- Reset review cleanly

Audit integrity preserved.

E. WHY THIS PATCH MATTERS
With this change:
- Companies are not punished for honesty
- Errors don’t force full resets
- Admins maintain control
- Investors are protected from silent edits

This is how regulated disclosures should work in practice.

F. WHAT STEP 2 ACHIEVES
After this UX:
- Companies know exactly what to do
- Admins receive clean, structured data
- Clarifications feel procedural, not adversarial
- Partial go-live is controlled and safe
- Audit trail is preserved without friction

This is issuer discipline by design.
