LIST C — PLATFORM CONTEXT & BRIDGING
What Only the Platform Should Add
This is where trust, compliance and differentiation live.

1. Disclosure Status & Confidence
- Disclosure completeness score
- Last verification date
- Areas with limited visibility

Example:
“Customer concentration data partially disclosed.”

2. Platform Interpretation
For each major section:
- What the company claims
- What the platform observes
- What investors should consider

This is context, not advice.

3. Standardized Company Score (Internal Model)
Platform-generated only:
- Financial health
- Governance quality
- Valuation reasonableness
- Risk intensity
- Liquidity outlook

Shown as grade bands, not numeric promises.

4. Red-Flag & Caveat Flags
- High promoter control
- Aggressive valuation
- Short cash runway
- Regulatory dependency

These are critical.

5. Admin Vetting & Change Log
- Reviewed by admin (yes/no)
- Number of clarification rounds
- Last material update date

This shows seriousness.

6. Regulatory Positioning
Explicit positioning aligned with bodies like SEBI:
- Platform is not an advisor
- No solicitation
- Disclosure facilitator role
- Investor responsibility emphasis

7. Investor Acknowledgements
Before purchase:
- Risk acknowledgment
- Illiquidity acknowledgment
- No-guarantee acknowledgment

Logged and timestamped.

HOW THIS WORKS AS A SYSTEM (IMPORTANT)
Flow Summary
1. Company submits → platform stores
2. Admin reviews → asks → re-reviews
3. Approval → controlled publication
4. Platform purchase shares → Create Inventory for users to buy 
5. Subscribers review → acknowledge → invest

Every step is:
- logged
- auditable
- defensible

Strategic Insight (Not To Skip)
What we are building is not a marketplace.

We are building:
A governed disclosure and decision engine for private capital.

This is exactly how we:
- avoid mis-selling
- reduce disputes
- survive regulatory scrutiny
- build long-term trust
