What TSX Files SHOULD Exist?

Below is a concrete, role-wise TSX file map.

A. COMPANY (ISSUER) FRONTEND — TSX EXPECTATION
1. Company Shell & Navigation
/company
 ├── CompanyLayout.tsx
 ├── CompanySidebar.tsx
 ├── CompanyHeader.tsx

Purpose
- Role-guarded layout
- Shows lifecycle status
- Shows progress indicators

2. Company Dashboard
/company/dashboard
 └── CompanyDashboard.tsx

Must render
- Tier progress bars
- “Next action required”
- Admin feedback summary
- Read-only lifecycle state

3. Disclosure Modules
/company/disclosures
 ├── DisclosureIndex.tsx
 ├── DisclosureModuleCard.tsx
 ├── DisclosureEditor.tsx
 ├── DisclosureVersionHistory.tsx

Key rule
- Editor enabled only if module is not approved
- Approved versions are view-only

4. Clarification Threads
/company/clarifications
 └── ClarificationThread.tsx

Must
- Be module-scoped
- Show admin questions verbatim
- Preserve chronology

B. ADMIN FRONTEND — TSX EXPECTATION
5. Admin Shell
/admin
 ├── AdminLayout.tsx
 ├── AdminSidebar.tsx

6. Admin Dashboard
/admin/dashboard
 └── AdminDashboard.tsx

Must show
- Pending reviews
- Companies by tier
- Clarifications awaiting response

7. Admin Company Review
/admin/companies
 ├── CompanyReview.tsx
 ├── DisclosureReviewPanel.tsx
 ├── DisclosureDiffViewer.tsx

Critical
- Diff viewer between disclosure versions
- Explicit approve / reject / clarify actions

8. Platform Context Review (Admin-only)
/admin/platform-context
 └── PlatformContextReview.tsx

Admins can review, not casually edit.

C. INVESTOR / SUBSCRIBER FRONTEND — TSX EXPECTATION
9. Public Company Listing
/invest
 └── CompanyListing.tsx

Must show
- Status badges
- Disclosure completeness
- Risk band
- No buy button yet

10. Company Detail Page (MOST IMPORTANT)
/invest/company
 ├── CompanyProfile.tsx
 ├── DisclosureSection.tsx
 ├── PlatformContextPanel.tsx
 ├── DisclosureStatusBadge.tsx

Hard separation
- Company disclosures ≠ Platform context
- Different visual language

If these are merged into one component → design violation.

11. Buy / Invest Flow
/invest/buy
 ├── BuyGate.tsx
 ├── RiskAcknowledgementModal.tsx
 ├── InvestmentForm.tsx

BuyGate.tsx must
- Block render unless Tier 2 approved
- Block if frozen
- Block if acknowledgements incomplete

12. Post-Investment Snapshot
/invest/portfolio
 └── InvestmentSnapshot.tsx

Must
- Render immutable snapshot
- Show “data as of investment date”
