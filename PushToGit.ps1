$CommitMessage = "feat(financial-core): freeze Financial Integrity Layer v1.0 (refund/chargeback hardened)

- Introduced ChargebackResolutionService as atomic refund/chargeback orchestrator
- Enforced full economic neutrality: payment, bonus, TDS, wallet, ledger symmetry
- Reinstated wallet debit on bonus reversal with shortfall reconciliation
- Added distributed + DB-level idempotency locks for refund processing
- Implemented deterministic bonus reversal via reversal_of_bonus_id FK (removed brittle description parsing)
- Created dedicated chargeback_receivables table for granular receivable tracking
    - FIFO settlement
    - Per-receivable status lifecycle (pending/partial/settled/written_off)
    - Ledger-linked audit trail
- Implemented recovery mode enforcement (withdrawals blocked, deposits allowed)
- Added automated recovery exit on full settlement
- Added admin force-clear with structured write-off flow
- Preserved DB constraints (no weakening of balance checks)
- Hardened double-entry integrity and balance conservation
- Updated invariant tests to reflect dedicated receivable model
- All bonus/refund-related tests passing (BonusTds, PaymentToBonus, Chargeback invariants)

Financial Core v1.0 is now:
- Deterministic
- Idempotent
- Audit-pure
- Ledger-balanced
- Recovery-aware

Next Wave: Allocation & Global Inventory Hardening"
