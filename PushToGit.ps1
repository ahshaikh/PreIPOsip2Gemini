$CommitMessage = "feat(disputes): harden chargeback engine after dual AI audits (Gemini + Claude)
- Conducted initial backend financial audit (Gemini) → identified structural gaps
- Performed second adversarial audit (Claude + Gemini) → uncovered additional invariants and lifecycle issues
- Remediated critical P0 findings in dispute/chargeback domain

Financial Corrections
- Implement NET chargeback model:
  net = investment_reversed - chargeback_amount
- Reverse allocation and revenue before wallet adjustment
- Ensure confirmed chargebacks reflect bank finality (no rollback of bank clawback)
- Enforce atomic execution via single DB transaction
- Remove nested transaction from reverseAllocationLegacy
- Route all wallet mutations through WalletService
- Block overdraft (wallet cannot go negative)
- Add defensive receivable handling for rare shortfall edge cases
- Preserve ledger ↔ wallet symmetry invariants

Safety & Integrity
- Add row-level locking (lockForUpdate)
- Enforce UNIQUE chargeback idempotency
- Add integration tests for:
  - Partial investment chargeback
  - Concurrency replay
  - Escalation scenarios
  - Ledger balance invariants

Final invariant state under NET model:
- Wallet = 0
- Income = 0
- Bank = 0
- Liability = 0
- No artificial receivables

Dispute domain now transactionally atomic, economically correct, and production-safe."
