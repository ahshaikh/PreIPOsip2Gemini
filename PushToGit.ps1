$CommitMessage = "feat(webhooks): add Stripe-grade reliability layers

- Implement 3-layer webhook protection architecture
  1. Replay protection via WebhookReplayGuard (signature + timestamp + atomic ledger)
  2. Event ordering protection using resource_id + event_timestamp
  3. Business idempotency via processed_webhook_events table

- Add payload_hash forensic tracking for duplicate event detection
- Introduce WebhookIdempotency trait with transactional execution guard
- Refactor handlers to strategy-based router architecture
- Extend webhook_event_ledger with resource_id, resource_type, event_timestamp
- Add ProcessWebhookJob ordering protection logic
- Implement provider-agnostic verifier extraction (Stripe/Razorpay)
- Add WebhookReliabilityTest for ordering and idempotency validation

All webhook reliability tests passing."
