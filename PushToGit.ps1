$CommitMessage = "refactor(financial-core): enforce subscription liability model, centralize chargebacks, align invariants

- Enforce SYSTEM_CONTEXT rule: subscription payments are NOT revenue
  - Remove recordSubscriptionIncome
  - Treat SUBSCRIPTION_PAYMENT as wallet credit (liability)
  - Revenue recognized only in recordShareSaleFromWallet

- Fix bonus ledger double-debit
  - recordBonusUsage now debits USER_WALLET_LIABILITY
  - Preserve wallet–ledger symmetry

- Harden chargeback flow
  - processChargebackAdjustment now owns all ledger orchestration
  - Remove manual ledger calls from webhook layer
  - Eliminate wallet-ledger desync risk

- Standardize WalletService balance semantics
  - balance_paise = total balance (including locked)
  - Prevent double-decrement during lock flows

- Refactor financial tests
  - Update FinancialGuaranteesTest for liability-based subscriptions
  - Update FinancialIntegrityInvariantTest for new credit logic
  - Align Epic4 tests with lifecycle + DB constraints

All core financial invariants passing:
- Double-entry integrity
- Wallet ↔ liability reconciliation
- Refund symmetry
- Balance sheet invariant"
