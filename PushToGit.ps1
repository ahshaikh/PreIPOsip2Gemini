$CommitMessage = "fix(refund, bonus-engine, wallet): enforce net bonus integrity & deterministic refund reversals

- Removed auto share-purchase from bonus flow (Option A: bonuses remain withdrawable cash)
- Fixed double-credit issue in ProcessPaymentBonusJob (wallet credited only once)
- Ensured wallet receives NET bonus (gross - TDS)
- Aligned share allocation logic to use NET amount where applicable
- Refactored refund logic to:
  - Reverse only original bonuses (exclude reversals)
  - Mirror gross + TDS symmetrically
  - Reverse wallet using deterministic NET calculation
  - Preserve double-entry ledger integrity
- Eliminated bonus drift after refund (net impact now zero)
- Updated PaymentToBonusIntegrationTest to assert wallet deltas via transactions instead of static balance values
- Fixed Queue assertion misuse in edge case test
- Stabilized state transition compliance (paid → refunded only)

Result:
- BonusTdsIntegrationTest fully passing
- PaymentToBonusIntegrationTest stabilized (net bonus invariants enforced)
- Wallet / ledger consistency preserved under refund + reversal scenarios"
