$CommitMessage = "feat(financial-core): implement single FinancialOrchestrator mutation boundary and complete lifecycle consolidation
Major architectural refactor introducing a centralized financial mutation boundary via FinancialOrchestrator.

Key achievements:
• Introduced FinancialOrchestrator as the single authority for:
* DB transactions
* row locking
* wallet mutations
* ledger mutations
* lifecycle orchestration

• Completed lifecycle consolidation across the system:
* Payment lifecycle
* Bonus lifecycle
* Referral lifecycle
* Withdrawal lifecycle
* Prize lifecycle (LuckyDraw)
* Profit share lifecycle
* Allocation lifecycle
* Chargeback lifecycle
* Dispute settlement lifecycle

• Refactored services to pure domain logic:
* BonusCalculatorService
* CelebrationBonusService
* ReferralService
* ProfitShareService
* LuckyDrawService
* AllocationService
* WithdrawalService
  Services now perform calculations and validations only.

• Removed direct financial mutations from:
* Controllers
* Jobs
* Domain services
* Legacy sagas

• Eliminated nested transaction ownership and moved lock acquisition to orchestrator.

• Fixed monetary precision regression:
* removed float usage
* enforced paise-based integer values for financial operations.

• Resolved lock ownership violations and centralized lock ordering.
• Consolidated celebration bonus pathways to a single orchestrated mutation flow.
• Updated StaticAnalysisHelper to enforce mutation governance rules.

Result:
System now enforces a **single financial orchestration boundary**, dramatically reducing race conditions, deadlocks, and parallel mutation pathways while improving auditability and lifecycle determinism."
