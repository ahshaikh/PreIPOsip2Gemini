$CommitMessage = "feat(payment): enforce external boundary integrity, atomic credit, and state machine safety

Payment Domain Hardening (V-PAYMENT-INTEGRITY-2026):

- Introduced strict payment state machine with transition enforcement
- Removed async wallet credit; payment status + wallet credit now atomic
- Moved wallet credit inside DB::transaction() boundary
- Added row-level locking and idempotency safeguards
- Implemented strict amount validation for one-time payments
- Enforced currency validation in webhook processing
- Added refund bounds validation (partial + full refund support)
- Introduced refund_amount_paise tracking and refund idempotency via refund_gateway_id
- Converted payment amount storage to integer paise (authoritative)
- Added settlement tracking columns (settled_at, settlement_id, settlement_status)
- Rewrote HandlePaymentWebhook to route through PaymentWebhookService
- Separated critical vs non-critical post-payment processing
- Added payment:reconcile artisan command

Architectural Outcome:
- Webhook replay cannot duplicate wallet credit
- Out-of-order events blocked via state machine
- Payment → Wallet mutation fully atomic
- No float-based monetary arithmetic
- Refunds cannot exceed credited amount
- External provider boundary hardened

Prepares system for final adversarial validation pass."
