$CommitMessage = "feat(epic-3): make disclosure tier the sole authority for promotion and public visibility

EPIC 3 — Restore Disclosure Authority (COMPLIANCE)

STORY 3.2 — Authoritative Tier Promotion
- Introduced DisclosureTierRequirements as single source of truth
- Promotion allowed ONLY when all required disclosures for next tier are approved
- No manual tier setting, no skipping, no downgrade
- Automatic, idempotent promotion triggered via DisclosureApproved domain event
- All promotions are transactional, deterministic, and auditable

STORY 3.3 — Visibility Refactor
- Removed deal-driven visibility logic (whereHas('deals', ...))
- Public visibility now depends ONLY on companies.disclosure_tier >= tier_2_live
- Creating or deleting a Deal no longer affects visibility
- Controllers now delegate visibility enforcement to disclosure tier scopes

ARCHITECTURAL INVARIANTS FROZEN
- Disclosure tier is the sole authority for:
  - Public visibility
  - Investability
  - Tier progression
- Deals never control visibility
- Tier changes are monotonic, event-driven, and immutable outside services

BREAKING BY DESIGN:
- Any code relying on deal existence for visibility is now invalid"
