$CommitMessage = "chore(disputes): finalize backend hardening, pass safety checklist, isolate test env

- Completed full backend remediation across dispute & risk domain (Phases 1–9)
- Enforced NET chargeback model with atomic execution
- Verified ledger invariants and wallet symmetry
- Implemented event-driven risk scoring with investment blocking
- Added Redis-backed overview cache with hourly warmup
- Implemented nightly dispute analytics aggregation
- Secured admin dispute API layer with pagination and RBAC
- Executed full backend safety checklist validation

Test Infrastructure Fix:
- Corrected phpunit.xml XML comment violations
- Switched test environment to SQLite in-memory database
- Fully isolated tests from main development database
- Eliminated MySQL savepoint instability
- Ensured deterministic and disposable test execution

Backend dispute engine is now:
- Financially consistent
- Transactionally atomic
- Risk-enforced
- Test-isolated
- Production-ready (backend layer)"
