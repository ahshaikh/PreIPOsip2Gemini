$CommitMessage = "feat(audit): declare system audit-complete with regulator-grade immutable views

- Finalize EPIC 6 Audit & Regulator Views
- Add read-only audit primitives (authority, actor, reason, timestamp, snapshot hash)
- Introduce Global Audit Dashboard and reconstruction anchor views
- Isolate audit surface under admin navigation (Audit & Compliance)
- Enforce explicit authority labeling and snapshot immutability
- Confirm end-to-end reconstructability of investor decisions

SYSTEM STATE:
- Backend governance invariants enforced (Epics 1–4)
- Frontend authority reflection complete (Epic 5)
- Regulator-grade audit surface complete (Epic 6)

This commit declares the company module AUDIT-COMPLETE.
Historical records are immutable and regulator-defensible.
Future changes must be introduced under new epics only."
